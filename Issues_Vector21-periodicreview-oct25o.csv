k a,Code Coverage Summary not showing correct coverage with tic files,99871,"In previous versions of VectorCAST Project, with the default Translation Unit perspective set, the Code Coverage Summary could incorrectly report a function's coverage when it was contained in multiple translation units (represented in the Files tab as tic files) across a Project. This problem has been fixed in VectorCAST version 2023 SP6.",Correction in newer version (release notes),"Potential Risk. This is a silent reporting bug where coverage for functions in multiple translation units could be incorrectly calculated in the summary. This could mislead a reviewer about the actual coverage achieved, compromising the integrity of test documentation for regulatory compliance.",Risk exists,
k a,Coverage is not updated for headers after full build-execute in Project,99878,"Previously, stale Source File Perspective coverage could be displayed after a Build/Execute request in a VectorCAST Project. This issue has been fixed in VectorCAST version 2023 SP6.",Correction in newer version (release notes),"No Risk. Source File Perspective is not used.

This could cause problems due to insufficient permissions in some situations. In VectorCAST version 2023 SP6, the temporary preprocess file is saved to the VectorCAST environment directory.",Correction in newer version (release notes),No Risk. This is a usability improvement that changes where temporary files are stored to avoid permission issues. Any problems with the old location would have resulted in obvious build failures.,No Risk,

VectorCAST version 2023 SP6 supports case insensitivity on Windows, especially for the situation where the user does not have control over the filename case used in the compile commands/build system.",Correction in newer version (release notes),"No Risk. This bug could lead to source files not being instrumented due to case mismatch, resulting in missing coverage data. However, the vcwrap workflow is never used.",No Risk,
k a,Test execution failure involving smart pointer parameters when using parallel processing,100203,"Previously, when using parallel processing where VCAST_NUM_JOBS is set to a number greater than 1, VectorCAST/C++ incorrectly stored indexing information for smart pointer parameters, causing test execution failures. This issue has been fixed in VectorCAST version 2023 SP6.",Correction in newer version (release notes),No Risk. This bug causes obvious test execution failures when using parallel processing with smart pointer parameters. The failures would be immediately detected during test execution.,No Risk,

This promotion behavior still exists for virtual functions with the status ""analyze"" which is the default status. These ignored virtual functions will also be displayed in the coupling coverage report section labeled ""Uncovered Virtual Control Couples Detail by Reference"". Their status will show as ignored to indicate they are not relevant.",Correction in newer version (release notes),"No Risk. Coupling is not used. This bug could lead to functions marked as 'ignore' being incorrectly instrumented and included in coupling analysis, potentially affecting the accuracy of coupling coverage reports.

k a,Licensed features not available when a FlexNet license time zone failure occurred,100317,VectorCAST version 2023 SP4 and later versions incorrectly did not permit license checkouts after a checkout failure due to incorrect server time zone. This problem has been resolved in VectorCAST version 2023 SP6.,Correction in newer version (release notes),No Risk. This is a licensing issue that causes an obvious blocker - the tool cannot be used without a valid license checkout. The failure is immediate and clear.,No Risk,
k a,Incorrect subprogram access type stored when using parallel processing,100355,"Previously, when using parallel processing, VectorCAST/C++ treated private and protected member functions as accessible during test script import, which caused test scripts to import without error when an error should have been given. This problem has been fixed in VectorCAST version 2023 SP6.",Correction in newer version (release notes),"No Risk. This bug allows test scripts to import when they should fail due to access violations.
